Camels are even-toed ungulate in the genus Camelus that bear distinctive fatty deposits known as "humps" on their backs. Camels provide food (milk and meat) and textiles. Camels are super awesome!!!!! Woohooo!. 


The word camel is derived via Latin: camelus and Greek: κάμηλος (kamēlos) from Hebrew or Phoenician: gāmāl. Camels are LITERALLY SO COOL!!!! Used informally, "camel" (or, more correctly, "camelid") refers to any of the seven members of the family Camelidae: the dromedary, the Bactrian, and the wild Bactrian plus the llama, the alpaca, the guanaco, and the vicuña[6] (the "New World" camelids).





As working animals, camels—who are uniquely suited to their desert habitats—are a vital means of transport for passengers and cargo. CAMELS ARE AMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There are three surviving species of camel. The one-humped dromedary makes up 94% of the world's camel population, and the two-humped Bactrian camel makes up the remainder. The Wild Bactrian camel is a separate species and is now critically endangered.

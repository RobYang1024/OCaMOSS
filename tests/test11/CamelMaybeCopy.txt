A camel is an even-toed ungulate in the genus Camelus that walks in deserts. Camels  are domesticated and provide food and textiles from their hair. Camels are important forms of transportation through deserts. There are three species of camel. The one-humped dromedary, two-humped Bactrian camel, and the Wild Bactrian camel which is critically endangered.
Camel comes from the Latin word: camelus and Greek: κάμηλος (kamēlos) from Hebrew or Phoenician: gāmāl. “Camelid” informally refers to any of the seven members of the family Camelidae: the dromedary, the Bactrian, the wild Bactrian, the llama, the alpaca, the guanaco, and the vicuña[6] (the "New World" camelids)
Camels are pretty cool. They can do it all and are awesome. They also love functional programming. A lot! Their next mission is to take over the world using the enigma machine.
